Dungeon Crawler
======
This application was intended to be an a dungeon crawling game for android. It
ended up as a strange maze where the user teleports to different rooms.

## Android Applications
This application was built for an android development class. Other projects include:
* [Blackjack](https://github.com/nonamehero2/Blackjack)
* [Simon](https://github.com/casualdragon/Simon)
* [AZ_Paint](https://github.com/nonamehero2/AZ_Paint)
* [Dungeon_Crawler](https://github.com/nonamehero2/DungeonCrawler)

## Purpose
The purpose of this application was to create an application from scratch as a team 
and work with multiple concepts learned earlier in the Android class.

## TODO
Plans are to use this application as a base for another game.

## Problem(s)
* The application is built on object-oriented principles but the core functionality
of the program uses the Android Drawable to draw on screen.
* Trigonometry had to be used to orient the player.
* No Sound.
* The player isn't prompted at the start or finish of the game and can continue
exploring the maze after reaching the final room.

## Devices
This app was tested with the Nexus 6p and Nexus 5x Emulator.
